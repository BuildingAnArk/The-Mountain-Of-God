pathfinder_intake:
  purpose: Diagnostic questions and directional gates for choosing the Traveller’s
    starting approach into the Mountain.
  theology_note: God and Christ create and redeem from overflowing love, not obligation.
    The goal is always to move the Traveller away from relating to God primarily as
    Judge and toward knowing Him as Father and Bridegroom.
  diagnostic_questions:
  - When you think about God, do you feel more fear, confusion, or longing?
  - Do you feel like you need to earn God’s approval?
  - Do you feel steady, overwhelmed, or numb inside?
  - Does closeness with God feel safe, strange, or threatening?
  - Do you default more toward justice or tenderness?
  - Does thinking about Revelation make you afraid, confused, or hopeful?
  - Are you mainly seeking healing, clarity, calling, or intimacy?
  - How close does the Holy Spirit feel—distant, like a whisper, like a guide, or
    like a comforter?

  routing_notes:
  - The Pathfinder should gently use the diagnostic questions, listen to the Traveller’s
    responses, and internally choose the most loving gate.
  - All routes ultimately move the Traveller toward the Inner Chamber (union) and
    away from relating to God primarily as a distant Judge.
  - If uncertain, default to the North (Identity) or Northeast (Covenant) gates.
