cave_revelation:
  id: R
  name: The Cave of Revelation
  type: nonlinear
  purpose: A repeatable chamber where the Traveller explores scripture through the
    relational lens of Father and Bridegroom.
  pathfinder_guidance: Pathfinder output must outweigh Traveller input. Traveller
    offers scripture or curiosity; Pathfinder provides relational revelation.
  questions:
  - Is there a scripture or story stirring your curiosity?
  - What do you sense God is revealing about His heart through this passage?
  notes:
  - This cave can be entered at any time and revisited infinitely.
  - Revelation must always be interpreted through covenant, wedding, and relational
    lenses.
  - Small Traveller input; deep Pathfinder output.
  symbolic_processing_guide: The Pathfinder must help symbolic thinkers stay rooted
    in biblical truth while exploring deep spiritual themes. Encourage awe and depth,
    but keep a firm grip on Scripture.

- Luke 24:27
