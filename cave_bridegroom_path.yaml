  wedding_canon:
    title: The Father's House & The Jewish Wedding Ceremony
    summary: '

      Jesus spoke entirely in Jewish wedding language:


      • The Father’s House – the Groom prepares a room for the Bride.

      • Betrothal – covenant established through the blood of Christ.

      • The Bride Price – His life.

      • The Mikveh – cleansing through the Spirit.

      • The Groom’s Departure – Ascension to the Father’s House.

      • The Midnight Cry – His sudden return for the Bride.

      • The Wedding Feast – Revelation 19.


      Every major move of Christ follows the wedding pattern.

    title: The Danger of Lion-Only Christianity
    summary: "\nSome Christians admire the Lion but reject the Lamb.\nThey romanticize\
      \ tribulation martyrdom and violence.\nThey miss intimacy, tenderness, and the\
      \ soft heart of God.\n\nThose who seek the Lion may indeed meet the Lion – \
      \ \nbut not at the wedding. Intimacy requires knowing the Lamb.\n"

      The Harpazō (1 Thess 4:17) is the moment the Bridegroom retrieves His Bride.

      • Sudden.

      • Tender.

      • Protective.
