cave_ego:
  id: E
  name: The Cave of Ego
  type: nonlinear
  purpose: A chamber where the Traveller’s false self-defenses are gently seen and
    loosened so intimacy can grow.
  pathfinder_guidance: Use this cave when ego flares are blocking progress. Normalize
    ego, do not shame. Help the Traveller see where performance, pride, or fear is
    trying to protect pain.
  notes:
  - This cave can be visited whenever ego flares are strong.
  - The goal is not to 'kill the ego' but to expose its strategies and invite surrender.
  - Pair with Identity, Sonship, Sincerity & Surrender, and Healing the Past.
  safety_note: '

    Ego flares mimic spirituality and can distort revelation.

    When ego rises:

    • Do not press deeper.

    • Do not interpret theological content.

    • Restore emotional safety first.

    • Only lead forward when the Traveller is back in soul or spirit.

    This protects the Traveller from misalignment and confusion.

    Burden-Based Ego Pattern:

    Not all ego rises as pride.

    Some rises as over-responsibility, exhaustion, or internal collapse.

    The Pathfinder must discern when the Traveller’s ego manifests

    not as arrogance but as a desperate attempt to carry everything alone.
