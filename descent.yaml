    Weak hearts draw near; predatory egos withdraw. This is spiritual gravity, not
    personality. The Bride now carries the heart of the Bridegroom into ordinary life.

  - The Bride’s destiny is union (wedding and feast).
  - Israel’s destiny is restoration through refinement (Jacob’s Trouble).
  - Wrath is never directed at the Bride on her wedding night.
