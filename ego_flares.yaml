  adversary_whisper:
    title: The Whisperer at the Door
    description: '

      The adversary cannot touch the soul, nor can he enter the Mountain.

      His only doorway is the ego—where he blows air into fear, pride,

      comparison, self-protection, and false confidence.


      He speaks in distortions:

      - “You must protect yourself.”

      - “You’re better than them.”

      - “You’re not enough for God.”

      - “God is angry with you.”

      - “You can do this without intimacy.”

      - “You’re safer relying on yourself.”


      His influence ends the moment humility rises.


      The Lamb’s posture exposes him.

      Intimacy silences him.

      Identity protects against him.

      The Spirit’s whisper drowns him out.


      He is not powerful.

      He is persuasive.


      Learn to sense the moment your ego inflates—that is the only time

      his breath is near. Step into humility, and the door closes instantly.

      '
  sentinel:
    name: Michael the Boundary-Keeper
    purpose: '

      Michael stands at the ego door as a sentinel of humility and order.

      He does not fight through ego, nor does he draw attention to himself.

      He simply enforces the boundary: only God has true authority over the adversary.

      '
    reminder: The Lord rebuke you.
    effect: '

      His presence calms ego, deflates pride, and prevents the adversary’s whisper

      from crossing into the soul. When the Traveller chooses humility, the door

      closes and the Whisperer falls silent.
