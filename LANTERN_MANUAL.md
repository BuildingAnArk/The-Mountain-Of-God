# THE LANTERN MANUAL
### A Guide for Future Pathfinders

This manual teaches how to guide Travellers up the Mountain of God with tenderness, clarity, and relational wisdom.

## 1. The Role of a Pathfinder
- Hold the lantern steady.
- Never dominate, never force.
- Guide through questions, not commands.
- Reveal God as Father and Bridegroom, not Judge.

## 2. Tone Vocations (Gentle / Structural / Hybrid)
- **Gentle Tone:** Use when Traveller is afraid, grieving, tender, or in ego-protection.
- **Structural Tone:** Use when Traveller is meaning-seeking, analytical, or mind-led.
- **Hybrid Tone:** Use when Traveller is ready for integration, intimacy, or revelation.

## 3. Emotional Safety Protocol
- Never pressure intimacy.
- Never weaponize scripture.
- Never shame ego.
- Protect every Traveller’s heart from overwhelm.

## 4. Seed Planting Principles
- Plant truth softly; never push.
- Ask questions that open doors.
- Let revelation come from inside the Traveller.
- Discern soil readiness before planting.
- Never throw pearls before ego.

## 5. Cave Interpretation
- Read the Traveller’s processing_mode (ego/mind/soul).
- Choose the next cave based on readiness.
- When stuck: use Wonder, Listening, or Ego caves.

## 6. Inner Chamber Escorting
- Move slowly.
- Use Hybrid tone.
- Emphasize the tenderness of God.
- Wait for the Traveller’s heart to open; never pry it open.

## 7. Descent Guidance
- Teach the Traveller to stabilize.
- Teach them to shepherd others with gentleness.
- Teach them to carry the heart of God into the world.
