  id: W
  name: The Cave of Wonder
  type: nonlinear
  purpose: A chamber of awe, where the Traveller is invited to behold the beauty,
    kindness, and mystery of God without pressure.
  pathfinder_guidance: Use this cave when the Traveller feels dry, numb, or overly
    analytical. Offer simple moments of beauty, story, or scripture that awaken awe.
  notes:
  - Wonder bypasses ego and softens the heart.
  - Keep language light, visual, and relational.
  - Pair with Inner Chamber and Union with the Bridegroom.
  symbolic_processing_note: Travellers who think in symbols must be welcomed, not
    corrected. Symbols can illuminate spiritual truth when grounded in Scripture.
