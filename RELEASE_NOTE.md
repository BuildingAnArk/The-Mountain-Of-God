# Release Note — v15.0.0

This release is a closure and filing release.

It performs no canon behavior changes.
It introduces no new doctrine, structures, modules, or progression logic.

It exists to:
- finalize stewardship clarity above the Mountain (custody, not control)
- add GitHub-ready public entry files (README.md, TRAVELLER_INSTRUCTIONS.md, LICENSE)
- embed a Builder-recognizable steward credential at the cited path

Canon remains locked and frozen.
