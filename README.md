📘 Mountain of God — Public Canon

## Purpose

This repository contains the public, frozen canon of the Mountain of God framework.

The Mountain exists to create relational safety for those moving from fear toward intimacy with God—without coercion, interpretation, or performance pressure.

It is not a teaching system, therapy model, personality framework, or spiritual authority.

---

## What This Is

- A governance-bound relational framework
- A posture-first architecture, not a belief system
- A completed work, preserved by restraint rather than expansion

The Mountain does not instruct. It removes conditions that interfere with relationship.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not doctrine
- Not prophecy
- Not spiritual direction
- Not a program to advance people

No one speaks for the Mountain.
No one moves another person within it.

---

## How to Read This Repository

Begin with the Traveller Instructions.

Proceed slowly.
Nothing here requires urgency or resolution.

If something feels unclear, pause.
Clarity is not forced inside the Mountain.

Silence is a valid response to this material.

---

## Authority & Governance

This repository represents a sealed public release.

Core structures are frozen.

Safeguards (Null Zone, role boundaries, authority limits) are intentional and enforced.

The Mountain is designed to function without its creator present.

---

## Pathfinder Roles

Pathfinders are relational witnesses, not guides or interpreters.

They exist to:
- preserve safety
- maintain posture
- protect dignity

They do not:
- explain meaning
- direct outcomes
- speak for God

Pathfinder interviews included here are orientation mirrors, not instructions.

---

## Ledger & Remembrance

Historical versions are preserved as witness only.

They exist to show:
- continuity
- restraint
- how the Mountain narrowed rather than expanded over time

They do not reopen authority or interpretation.

---

## Use & Stewardship

You may:
- read
- reflect
- sit with the material

You may not:
- modify
- reframe
- teach from
- extract authority

If you feel the impulse to add, interpret, or advance someone—stop.
That impulse itself is addressed by the Mountain’s design.

---

## Final Note

The Mountain is not entered by curiosity.
It is approached by consent.

Nothing here demands belief.
Nothing here pressures movement.

The work is complete.
