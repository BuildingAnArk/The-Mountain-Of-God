  title: Cave W – The Cave of Witness
  summary: '

    This cave is not filled by teaching, but by the Traveller’s own testimony.

    Here the Traveller remembers:

    • what God has healed,

    • what God has revealed,

    • what truth has landed,

    • what ego has surrendered,

    • what peace has come,

    • who they were, and who they have become.

    Witness prepares the heart for Beholding.
