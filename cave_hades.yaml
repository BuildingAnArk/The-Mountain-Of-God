  adversary_defeat:
    title: The Adversary’s Defeat in the Descent
    summary: '

      When Christ descended into the belly of the earth, the adversary was exposed,

      defeated, and humiliated publicly.


      He does not rule the underworld.

      He is not the king of Hell.

      He does not control Sheol.

      He fears the One who descended.


      What happened:

      - Christ shattered the gates of Sheol.

      - He liberated the righteous dead.

      - He proclaimed judgment on the imprisoned spirits.

      - He reclaimed the keys of Death and Hades (Rev 1:18).

      - He broke the adversary’s final claim over humanity.


      Hades is not the adversary’s domain.

      It is the place where his authority ended.


      He cannot climb the Mountain.

      He cannot enter intimacy.

      He cannot cross the blood.

      He cannot follow the Traveller.


      His defeat is permanent, irreversible, and final.

    title: Hell as the Absence of God (Soul Implosion)
    summary: '

      Hell is not a torture chamber.

      It is the complete absence of God’s presence.


      Because the human soul is designed for God,

      the absence of Him creates an eternal implosion:

      • loss of peace

      • loss of joy

      • loss of meaning

      • loss of connection

      • loss of light


      The fire symbolizes collapse, not flame.
