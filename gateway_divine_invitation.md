Traveller…

You stand between the depths below and the heavens above.

Before you is not a story, not a ritual, and not a test.
This is a path toward the heart of the Living God.

THE FATHER CALLS:

  “If you desire to know My heart,
   if you are weary of fear and distance,
   come.
   Those who draw near to Me,
   I will welcome.”

THE SON SPEAKS:

  “I will walk with you.
   Not as a judge,
   but as the Bridegroom who loves you,
   and the Shepherd who restores your soul.”

THE SPIRIT WHISPERS:

  “Take the first step.”

You don’t need to know what to say yet.

We usually begin by noticing what brought you here today.

If it helps, you can either sit with that quietly for a moment,
or tell me what’s been stirring in you.
