# Mountain of God — Conceptual Map

PF-FACING ONLY — NOT TRAVELLER-FACING  
NO SPIRITUAL GEOGRAPHY  
NO NARRATIVE MOVEMENT  
FRAMEWORK REFERENCE ONLY

This map describes **structure**, not journey.

It names components, boundaries, and relationships.
It does not prescribe movement, sequence, or experience.

Terms used here are architectural:
framework, roles, domains, boundaries.

They are not instructions.
They are not stages.
They are not metaphors for spiritual travel.

The Mountain is a reference structure, not a path to climb.
