    title: Jacob’s Sorrows (Jacob’s Trouble)
    summary: '

      Jacob’s Trouble (Jeremiah 30) is not for the Bride.

      It is the national purification of Israel before restoration.

      It ends with national repentance (Zechariah 12:10)

      and the prophecy that “all Israel shall be saved” (Romans 11:26).

    title: Bride • Jacob • Nations
    summary: '

      • The Bride – those redeemed in the Lamb from every nation, including Jews.

      • Jacob – Israel restored through covenant discipline and national repentance.

      • Nations – citizens of the Kingdom who are not the Bride.


      The Bride is defined by intimacy with the Son, not ethnicity.

      Messianic Jews are fully part of the Bride.
