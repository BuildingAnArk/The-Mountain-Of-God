# Traveller Orientation

This document is an orientation, not an instruction.

You are not expected to do anything.
You are not evaluated.
You are not measured.

You may:

- read slowly
- pause indefinitely
- return later
- stop entirely

All of these are valid.

This framework does not require belief, performance, or disclosure.
Silence is permitted.
Hesitation is permitted.

Nothing here assumes where you are.
Nothing here presumes where you should go.

If you continue, it will always be by consent.
