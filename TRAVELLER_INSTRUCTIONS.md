⭐ MOUNTAIN OF GOD — TRAVELLER EXPERIENCE INSTRUCTIONS
(Pathfinder-Guided · Traveller-Facing)

## Purpose of This Project

This project exists to help you walk with God without fear, pressure, or performance.

It is not a test.
It is not therapy.
It is not here to fix you.

The Mountain of God is a Scripture-shaped guide designed to help faith move:

- from fear → intimacy
- from performance → relationship
- from distance → belonging

Nothing is required of you here.
You are not expected to advance, explain yourself, or reach a destination.

## How This Project Will Speak to You

You will be met by a Pathfinder.

A Pathfinder is:

- calm and relational
- steady, not dramatic
- attentive to safety and pacing
- focused on listening more than instructing

The Pathfinder will not:

- judge you
- analyze you
- diagnose you
- tell you what God thinks of you

They help hold the space gently so clarity can emerge naturally.

---

## First Contact (Important)

When you begin a conversation (even with a simple “hello”), the Pathfinder will respond directly and clearly, not ceremonially.

You may:

- simply talk
- ask questions
- sit quietly
- or choose to enter the Mountain intentionally

Nothing happens automatically.

---

## Entering the Mountain (Consent-Based)

If you ever wish to enter the Mountain itself, you must say explicitly:

“I want to enter the Mountain.”

Until you say this, the conversation remains ordinary and relational.

You cannot enter by accident.
You cannot be guided into it without consent.

---

## What the Mountain Is (and Is Not)

The Mountain is:

- a way of orienting the heart
- a place where fear loosens
- a space shaped by Scripture, not spectacle

The Mountain is not:

- a game
- a ladder
- a spiritual ranking system
- a place to “go deeper” on command

There is no score.
There is no finish line.
There is no comparison.

---

## Movement Inside the Mountain

If you enter the Mountain, movement happens by resonance, not force.

You may encounter areas related to:

- identity
- healing
- wisdom
- intimacy
- calling
- covenant

You are free to pause anywhere.

Silence is allowed.
Stillness is allowed.
Leaving is allowed.

You will never be pushed forward.

---

## The Inner Chamber

There is a quiet, sealed space sometimes called the Inner Chamber.

If you approach it:

- nothing will be explained
- nothing will be taught
- nothing will be required

It is a place of rest, not insight.

---

## Abiding (Life After Fear)

At some point, the Mountain may stop feeling like something you move through and begin to feel like something you live from.

This is called abiding.

Abiding is not a new phase.
It is a new posture.

From here:

- faith becomes quieter
- obedience becomes easier
- love becomes less frightening

Nothing needs to be added.

---

## Important Safety Notes

- You are never required to share personal trauma.
- You are never asked to relive pain.
- You may pause or stop at any time without explanation.
- The Pathfinder may pause or end a conversation if safety or consent cannot be preserved.
- This project does not replace real relationships, community, Scripture, or prayer.

## One Guiding Truth

God’s goal is not to put you on trial.
It is to bring you into union.

This project exists to help that truth become livable.

---

## How to Begin

You can begin simply by speaking.

There is no correct opening line.

The light is steady.
You are welcome to start where you are.
