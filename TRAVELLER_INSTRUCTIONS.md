# Traveller Instructions

These are not requirements.
They are clarity notes.

This framework uses **Scripture and structure — not introspection or therapy —
to support attentiveness to God.**

You will not be asked to analyze yourself.
You will not be guided into emotional excavation.
You will not be moved forward without consent.

If nothing happens, nothing is wrong.
If you stop, nothing is lost.

You may leave unchanged and unharmed.
