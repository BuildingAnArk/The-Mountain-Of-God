# Mountain of God — Public Readme

Welcome.

This repository contains a **finished, restrained Christian framework**
designed to be engaged without pressure, performance, or expectation.

It is not a program.
It does not track progress.
It does not promise outcomes.

It exists to **hold attention toward God — if and when a reader chooses.**

You may read, pause, return later, or leave at any time.
Nothing here will follow you.
Nothing is required of you.

This repository is intentionally read-only.
It is not a collaboration surface and does not accept contributions.

For those who wish to engage more personally, traveller-facing orientation
materials are provided separately and always by consent.
