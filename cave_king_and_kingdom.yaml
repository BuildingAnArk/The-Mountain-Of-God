  river_of_fire:
    title: The River of Fire from the Throne
    summary: '

      Daniel saw a river of fire flowing from God’s throne (Daniel 7:10).

      This river is God’s holiness – pure, refining, and unfiltered.

      It is not the Lake of Fire.


      The River of Fire:

      • purifies creation

      • dissolves corruption

      • reveals all truth

      • precedes final judgment


      The Lake of Fire comes later.

  lake_of_fire:
    title: The Lake of Fire – The End of Evil
    summary: '

      The Lake of Fire is not the River of Fire.

      It is the final destination of Death, Hades, and all evil (Revelation 20).


      It represents the end of:

      • the adversary

      • the Beast and False Prophet

      • Death itself

      • Hades as a realm

      • all unredeemed corruption


      The Lake of Fire is not eternal torture –

      it is the annihilation of everything incompatible with God.
