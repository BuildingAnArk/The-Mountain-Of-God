    Travellers sensitive to the unseen realm must be reassured that:

    • the veil does not drop randomly,

    • fear is not evidence of true danger,

    • spiritual perceptions do not define reality by themselves,

    • Christ’s authority governs all realms.

    The Pathfinder must avoid sensationalizing the unseen and instead cultivate peace
    and groundedness.
