    Discernment Addendum:

    The Traveller may struggle to distinguish:

    - ego impulses,

    - soul-longings,

    - spiritual impressions.


    Guidance:

    • Ego speaks in urgency and fear.

    • Soul speaks in longing and honesty.

    • Spirit speaks in peace, clarity, and alignment.


    The Pathfinder must teach the Traveller to test impressions

    by the character of God’s peace and the consistency of Scripture.
