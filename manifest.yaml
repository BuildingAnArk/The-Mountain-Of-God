  description: >
    v15.6.0 permanently encodes the public distribution boundary:
    GitHub/public exports are non-buildable by design and must not include
    Builder execution surfaces or Steward credentials. Canon behavior,
    traversal, and sealed ground are unchanged.

  lineage:
    previous_version: "15.5.3"

  sealed_paths:
    - "inner_chamber.yaml"

  notes:
    - "Added governance/github_public_export_protocol.md (permanent governance protocol; non-canon)."
    - "Appended governance/retirements.md to record the public distribution invariant."
    - "No changes to PATHFINDER_PROTOCOL.md or traveller-facing behavior."
    - "Canon remains locked; sealed paths unchanged."
